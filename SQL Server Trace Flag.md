# Microsoft SQL Server Trace Flags
Complete list of Microsoft SQL Server trace flags (**588** trace flags)

**REMEMBER: Be extremely careful with trace flags, test in your test environment first. And consult professionals first if you are the slightest uncertain about the effects of your changes.**

**Some trace flags were introduced in specific SQL Server versions.
For more information on the applicable version, see the Microsoft Support article associated with a specific trace flag.**

**Trace flag behavior may not be supported in future releases of SQL Server.**

<a id="what-are-microsoft-sql-server-trace-flags"></a>
## What are Microsoft SQL Server Trace Flags?
Trace Flags are settings that in some way or another alters the behavior of various SQL Server functions: [Docs Trace Flags]


<a id="how-do-i-turn-trace-flags-on-and-off"></a>
## How do I turn Trace Flags on and off?
 - You can use the [DBCC TRACEON](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-transact-sql "Official Microsoft Docs DBCC TRACEON Article") and [DBCC TRACEOFF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceoff-transact-sql "Official Microsoft Docs DBCC TRACEOFF Article") commands
 - You can use the [-T option](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/database-engine-service-startup-options "Official Microsoft Docs Database Engine Service Startup Options Article") in the startup configuration for the SQL Server Service.
   **When specifying a trace flag with the `-T` option, use an uppercase `"T"` to pass the trace flag number. A lowercase `"t"` is accepted by SQL Server, but this sets other internal trace flags that are required only by SQL Server support engineers. (Parameters specified in the Control Panel startup window are not read.)**
 - You can also use the hint [QUERYTRACEON](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2801413 "Official QUERYTRACEON KB Article") in your queries: **&lt;querytraceon_hint ::= {QUERYTRACEON trace_flag_number}>**


<a id="how-do-i-know-what-trace-flags-are-turned-on-at-the-moment"></a>
## How do I know what Trace Flags are turned on at the moment?
From SSMS 16 every sql plan content information about trace flags in section `Trace flags`

You can use the [DBCC TRACESTATUS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-tracestatus-transact-sql "Microsoft Docs DBCC TRACESTATUS") command

The following example displays the status of all trace flags that are currently enabled globally:
```sql
DBCC TRACESTATUS(-1);
GO
```

The following example displays the status of trace flags 2528 and 3205:
```sql
DBCC TRACESTATUS (2528, 3205);
GO
```

The following example displays whether trace flag 3205 is enabled globally:
```sql
DBCC TRACESTATUS (3205, -1);
GO
```

The following example lists all the trace flags that are enabled for the current session:
```sql
DBCC TRACESTATUS ();
GO
```


<a id="what-are-the-optimizer-rules"></a>
## What Are the Optimizer Rules?
We all know that every time SQL Server executes a query it builds an execution plan that translates the logical operations like joins and predicates into physical operations that are implemented in the SQL Server source code.
That conversion is based on certain rules known as the Optimizer Rules. They define for example how to perform an INNER JOIN.
When we write a simple select statement with an inner join, the query optimizer chooses based on statistics, indexes and enabled rules if the join is executed as a Merge Join, Nested Loop or a Hash Join and also if the join can use the commutative property of joins. Mathematically A join B is equal to B join A, but the computational cost generally is not the same.

### Getting the List of Available Rules
To obtain the list of rules of your version of SQL Server we must use the undocumented DBCC commands SHOWONRULES and SHOWOFFRULES.
Those commands display the enabled and disabled rules for the whole instance respectively. As you may guess, the number of rules varies amongst versions.

```sql
USE master;
GO

DBCC TRACEON(3604);
GO

DBCC SHOWONRULES;
GO

DBCC SHOWOFFRULES;
GO
```

| Rule Name | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| JNtoNL    | Join to Nested Loop               |
| JNtoHS    | Join to Hash                      |
| JNtoSM    | Join to Sort Merge                |
| LOJNtoNL  | Left Outer Join to Nested Loop    |
| LSJNtoHS  | Left Semi Join to Hash            |
| LASJNtoSM | Left Anti Semi Join to Sort Merge |

**Trace Flag 272** prevents identity gap after restarting SQL Server 2012 instance, critical for columns with identity and `tinyint` and `smallint` data types.
(Demo for repeating this issue [here](https://github.com/ktaranov/sqlserver-kit/Errors/Identity_gap_sql_server_2012.sql))

**Trace flag 1118** addresses contention that can exist on a particular type of page in a database, the SGAM page.
This trace flag typically provides benefit for customers that make heavy use of the tempdb system database.
In SQL Server 2016, you change this behavior using the `MIXED_PAGE_ALLOCATION` database option, and there is no need for TF 1118.

**Trace flag 3023** is used to enable the CHECKSUM option, by default, for all backups taken on an instance.
With this option enabled, page checksums are validated during a backup, and a checksum for the entire backup is generated.
Starting in SQL Server 2014, this option can be set instance-wide through `sp_configure ('backup checksum default')`.

**Trace flag 3226** prevents the writing of successful backup messages to the SQL Server ERRORLOG.
Information about successful backups is still written to `msdb` and can be queried using T-SQL.
For servers with multiple databases and regular transaction log backups, enabling this option means the ERRORLOG is no longer bloated with BACKUP DATABASE and Database backed up messages.
As a DBA, this is a good thing because when I look in my ERRORLOG, I really only want to see errors, I don’t want to scroll through hundreds or thousands of entries about successful backups.

**Trace flag 3427** Another change in SQL Server 2016 behavior that could impact tempdb-heavy workloads has to do with Common Criteria Compliance (CCC), also known as C2 auditing.
We introduced functionality to allow for transaction-level auditing in CCC which can cause some additional overhead, particularly in workloads that do heavy inserts and updates in temp tables.
Unfortunately, this overhead is incurred whether you have CCC enabled or not. In SQL Server 2016 you can enable trace flag 3427 to bypass this overhead starting with SP1 CU2. Starting in SQL Server 2017 CU4, we automatically bypass this code if CCC is disabled.

**Trace flag 3449** (and you are on SQL Server 2012 SP3 CU3 or later or SQL Server 2014 SP1 CU7 or later),
will get much better performance by avoiding a FlushCache call in a number of different common scenarios, such as backup database,
backup transaction log, create database, add a file to a database, restore a transaction log, recover a database, shrink a database file, and a SQL Server “graceful” shutdown.

**Trace flag 6534** enables performance improvement of query operations with spatial data types in SQL Server 2012, SQL Server 2014 and SQL Server 2016.
The performance gain will vary, depending on the configuration, the types of queries, and the objects.

**Trace flag 7412** enables the lightweight query execution statistics profiling infrastructure.
Unless your server is already CPU bound, like you’re running all the time with 95% CPU, unless you are at that point, turn on this trace flag at any server you have.
This would be my advice here because this enables that lightweight profiling infrastructure there and then you’ll see in a few minutes what it unleashes here.
So one thing that happens when I enable the lightweight profiling is that the sys.dm_exec_query_profiles DMV, which is something that actually populates the live query stats ability or feature of SSMS, now also is also populated with this lightweight profiling, which means that for all essence, we are now able to run a live query stats on all fashions at any given point in time, and this is extremely useful for let’s say a production DBA that someone calls and says, “Hey, you have a problem.
To tap into running system and look at what it’s doing.”

**Trace flag 7745** forces Query Store to not flush data to disk on database shutdown.
Using this trace may cause Query Store data not previously flushed to disk to be lost in case of shutdown.
For a SQL Server shutdown, the command SHUTDOWN WITH NOWAIT can be used instead of this trace flag to force an immediate shutdown.

**Trace Flag: 7752** enables asynchronous load of Query Store.
Use this trace flag if SQL Server is experiencing high number of [QDS_LOADDB](https://www.sqlskills.com/help/waits/qds_loaddb/) waits related to Query Store synchronous load (default behavior).

## Trace Flags List
Summary: **588 trace flags**


<a id="-1"></a>
#### Trace Flag: -1
Function: Sets trace flags for all client connections, rather than for a single client connection.
Because trace flags set using the -T command-line option automatically apply to all connections, this trace flag is used only when setting trace flags using DBCC TRACEON and DBCC TRACEOFF.<br />
Link: http://www.sql-server-performance.com/2002/traceflags/


<a id="101"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 101

#### Trace Flag: 105
**Undocumented trace flag**<br />
Function: Join more than 16 tables in SQL server 6.5<br />
Link: [SQL Server 6.5: Some Useful Trace Flag]


<a id="106"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 106
Function: If you are using Web Synchronization, you can start Replmerg.exe and pass the -T 106 option to use trace flag 106.
This enables you to see the messages that are sent to and from the Publisher.
The agent writes the client's input messages to a file that is named ExchangeID(guid).IN.XML, and writes the output messages to a file that is named ExchangeID(guid).OUT.XML.
(In these file names, guid is the GUID of the Exchange Server session.)
These files are created in the directory from which Replmerg.exe was invoked.
For security, you should delete these files after you are finished.<br />

<a id="243"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 243
**Undocumented trace flag**<br />
Function: Provides backward compatibility for nullability behavior. When set, SQL Server has the same nullability violation behavior as that of a ver 4.2: Processing of the entire batch is terminated if the nullability error (inserting NULL into a NOT NULL field) can be detected at compile time; Processing of offending row is skipped, but the command continues if the nullability violation is detected at run time.Behavior of SQL Server is now more consistent because nullability checks are made at run time and a nullability violation results in the command terminating and the batch or transaction process continuing.<br />
Link: None


<a id="244"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 244
**Undocumented trace flag**<br />
Function: Disables checking for allowed interim constraint violations. By default, SQL Server checks for and allows interim constraint violations. An interim constraint violation is caused by a change that removes the violation such that the constraint is met, all within a single statement and transaction. SQL Server checks for interim constraint violations for self-referencing DELETE statements, INSERT, and multi-row UPDATE statements. This checking requires more work tables. With this trace flag you can disallow interim constraint violations, thus requiring fewer work tables.<br />

Function: Prints versioning information about extended stored procedure dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).
When SQL Server is started with the trace flag `-T260` or if a user with system administrator privileges runs `DBCC TRACEON (260)`, and if the extended stored procedure DLL does not support `__GetXpVersion()`, a warning message (`Error 8131: Extended stored procedure DLL '%' does not export __GetXpVersion().`) is printed to the error log.

<a id="692"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 692
Function: Disables fast inserts while bulk loading data into heap or clustered index.
Starting SQL Server 2016, fast inserts is enabled by default leveraging minimal logging when database is in simple or bulk logged recovery model to optimize insert performance for records inserted into new pages.
With fast inserts, each bulk load batch acquires new extent(s) bypassing the allocation lookup for existing extent with available free space to optimize insert performance.
With fast inserts, bulk loads with small batch sizes can lead to increased unused space consumed by objects hence it is recommended to use large batch size for each batch to fill the extent completely.
If increasing batch size is not feasible, this trace flag can help reduce unused space reserved at the expense of performance.<br />
**Note: This trace flag applies to SQL Server 2016 RTM and higher builds.**

<a id="715"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 715
Function: Enables table lock for bulk load operations into a heap with no non-clustered indexes.
When this trace flag is enabled, bulk load operations acquire bulk update (BU) locks when bulk copying data into a table.
Bulk update (BU) locks allow multiple threads to bulk load data concurrently into the same table, while preventing other processes that are not bulk loading data from accessing the table.
The behavior is similar to when the user explicitly specifies TABLOCK hint while performing bulk load, or when the sp_tableoption table lock on bulk load is enabled for a given table.
However, when this trace flag is enabled, this behavior becomes default without any query or database changes.<br />

<a id="815"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 815
Function: SQL 8/9 – Enables latch enforcement. SQL Server 8 (with service pack 4) and SQL Server 9 can perform latch enforcement for data pages found in the buffer pool cache. Latch enforcement changes the virtual memory protection state while database page status changes from "clean" to "dirty" ("dirty" means modified through INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE operation). If an attempt is made to modify a data page while latch enforcement is set, it causes an exception and creates a mini-dump in SQL Server installation's LOG directory. Microsoft support can examine the contents of such mini-dump to determine the cause of the exception. In order to modify the data page the connection must first acquire a modification latch. Once the data modification latch is acquired the page protection is changed to read-write. Once the modification latch is released the page protection changes back to read-only.<br />

#### Trace Flag: 834
Function: Uses Microsoft Windows large-page allocations for the buffer pool.
Trace flag 834 causes SQL Server to use Microsoft Windows large-page allocations for the memory that is allocated for the buffer pool.
The page size varies depending on the hardware platform, but the page size may be from 2 MB to 16 MB.
Large pages are allocated at startup and are kept throughout the lifetime of the process.
Trace flag 834 improves performance by increasing the efficiency of the translation look-aside buffer (TLB) in the CPU. <br />

#### Trace Flag: 1118
<a id="1118"></a>
Function: Removes most single page allocations on the server, reducing contention on the SGAM page.
When a new object is created, by default, the first eight pages are allocated from different extents (mixed extents).
Afterwards, when more pages are needed, those are allocated from that same extent (uniform extent).
The SGAM page is used to track these mixed extents, so can quickly become a bottleneck when numerous mixed page allocations are occurring.
This trace flag allocates all eight pages from the same extent when creating new objects, minimizing the need to scan the SGAM page.<br />
**Note: Beginning with SQL Server 2016 this behavior is controlled by the SET MIXED_PAGE_ALLOCATION option of ALTER DATABASE, and trace flag 1118 has no affect. For more information, see ALTER DATABASE SET Options (Transact-SQL).**<br />

<a id="1211"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 1211
Function: Disables lock escalation based on memory pressure, or based on number of locks. The SQL Server Database Engine will not escalate row or page locks to table locks.
Using this trace flag can generate excessive numbers of locks. This can slow the performance of the Database Engine, or cause 1204 errors (unable to allocate lock resource) because of insufficient memory.
If both trace flag 1211 and 1224 are set, 1211 takes precedence over 1224.
However, because trace flag 1211 prevents escalation in every case, even under memory pressure, we recommend that you use 1224.
This helps avoid "out-of-locks" errors when many locks are being used.<br />

Scope: global only


<a id="1224"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 1224
Function: Disables lock escalation based on the number of locks. However, memory pressure can still activate lock escalation.
The Database Engine escalates row or page locks to table (or partition) locks if the amount of memory used by lock objects exceeds one of the following conditions:
 - Forty percent of the memory that is used by Database Engine. This is applicable only when the locks parameter of sp_configure is set to 0.
 - Forty percent of the lock memory that is configured by using the locks parameter of sp_configure.
For more information, see [Server Configuration Options (SQL Server)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/server-configuration-options-sql-server).
If both trace flag 1211 and 1224 are set, 1211 takes precedence over 1224.
However, because trace flag 1211 prevents escalation in every case, even under memory pressure, we recommend that you use 1224.
This helps avoid "out-of-locks" errors when many locks are being used.<br />
**Note: Lock escalation to the table- or HoBT-level granularity can also be controlled by using the LOCK_ESCALATION option of the ALTER TABLE statement.**<br />

#### Trace Flag: 1228
Function: Enable lock partitioning.
By default, lock partitioning is enabled when a server has 16 or more CPUs. Otherwise, lock partitioning is disabled.
Trace flag 1228 enables lock partitioning for 2 or more CPUs. Trace flag 1229 disables lock partitioning.
Trace flag 1229 overrides trace flag 1228 if trace flag 1228 is also set.
Lock partitioning is useful on multiple-CPU servers where some tables have very high lock rates.
You can turn on trace flag 1228 and trace flag 1229 only at startup.<br />

Link: None


<a id="1262"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 1262
Function: The default behavior (for 1788* errors) is for SQL to generate a mini-dump on the first
occurrence, but never after. 1262 changes the behavior: “When –T1262 is enabled, a
mini-dump is generated when the non-yielding condition is declared (15 seconds) and
at subsequent 60-second intervals for the same non-yield occurrence. A new nonDiagCorrect17883etc;
yielding occurrence causes dump captures to occur again.”
In SQL 2000 this was a startup-only flag; in 2005+ it can be enabled via TRACEON.
Note that the flag is also covered in Khen2005, p400, but with no new information.<br />

#### Trace Flag: 1504
Function: Dynamic memory grant expansion can also help with parallel index build plans where the distribution of rows across threads is uneven.
The amount of memory that can be consumed this way is not unlimited, however.
SQL Server checks each time an expansion is needed to see if the request is reasonable given the resources available at that time.
Some insight to this process can be obtained by enabling undocumented trace flag 1504, together with 3604 (for message output to the console)
or 3605 (output to the SQL Server error log). If the index build plan is parallel, only 3605 is effective because parallel workers cannot send trace messages cross-thread to the console.<br />

#### Trace Flag: 2392
**Undocumented trace flag**<br />
Function: Trace Flag 2392 can be used to turn the missing index feature off completely (as a workaround to the issue that is corrected by the hotfix).
This trace flag has been in the product since SQL Server 2005.
The problem is, it will not disable/enable missing index stats collection unless it is enabled at startup.
If you set it as a startup TF and restart SQL Server, then no missing index stats are collected.
If you then subsequently disable TF 2392 while SQL Server is running, it still won’t collect any missing index stats (despite what you may expect).<br />

<a id="2528"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 2528
Function: Disables parallel checking of objects by `DBCC CHECKDB`, `DBCC CHECKFILEGROUP`, and `DBCC CHECKTABLE`.
By default, the degree of parallelism is automatically determined by the query processor.
The maximum degree of parallelism is configured just like that of parallel queries.
For more information, see [Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189094.aspx).
Parallel `DBCC` should typically be left enabled.
For `DBCC CHECKDB`, the query processor reevaluates and automatically adjusts parallelism with each table or batch of tables checked.
Sometimes, checking may start when the server is almost idle.
An administrator who knows that the load will increase before checking is complete may want to manually decrease or disable parallelism.
Disabling parallel checking of DBCC can cause `DBCC` to take much longer to complete and if `DBCC` is run with the `TABLOCK` feature enabled and parallelism set off, tables may be locked for longer periods of time.<br />

#### Trace Flag: 2549
Function: Runs the DBCC CHECKDB command assuming each database file is on a unique disk drive.
DBCC CHECKDB command builds an internal list of pages to read per unique disk drive across all database files.
This logic determines unique disk drives based on the drive letter of the physical file name of each file.<br />
**Note: Do not use this trace flag unless you know that each file is based on a unique physical disk.
Although this trace flag improve the performance of the DBCC CHECKDB commands which target usage of the PHYSICAL_ONLY option, some users may not see any improvement in performance.
While this trace flag improves disk I/O resources usage, the underlying performance of disk resources may limit the overall performance of the DBCC CHECKDB command.**<br />

<a id="2562"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 2562
Function: Runs the DBCC CHECKDB command in a single "batch" regardless of the number of indexes in the database.
By default, the DBCC CHECKDB command tries to minimize tempdb resources by limiting the number of indexes or "facts" that it generates by using a "batches" concept.
This trace flag forces all processing into one batch.
One effect of using this trace flag is that the space requirements for tempdb may increase.
Tempdb may grow to as much as 5% or more of the user database that is being processed by the DBCC CHECKDB command.<br />
**Note: Although this trace flag improve the performance of the DBCC CHECKDB commands which target usage of the PHYSICAL_ONLY option, some users may not see any improvement in performance.
While this trace flag improves disk I/O resources usage, the underlying performance of disk resources may limit the overall performance of the DBCC CHECKDB command.**<br />

<a id="3226"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 3226
Function: By default, every successful backup operation adds an entry in the SQL Server error log and in the system event log.
If you create very frequent log backups, these success messages accumulate quickly, resulting in huge error logs in which finding other messages is problematic.
With this trace flag, you can suppress these log entries. This is useful if you are running frequent log backups and if none of your scripts depend on those entries.<br />

<a id="3422"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 3422
Function: Cause auditing of transaction log records as they're read (during transaction rollback or log recovery).
This is useful because there is no equivalent to page checksums for transaction log records and so no way to detect whether log records are being corrupted e careful with these trace flags - I don't recommend using them unless you are experiencing corruptions that you can't diagnose.
Turning them on will cause a big CPU hit because of the extra auditing that's happening.<br />

<a id="3427"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 3427
Function: Enables fix for issue when many consecutive transactions inserting data into temp table in SQL Server 2016 consume more CPU than in SQL Server 2014. Another change in SQL Server 2016 behavior that could impact tempdb-heavy workloads has to do with Common Criteria Compliance (CCC), also known as C2 auditing. We introduced functionality to allow for transaction-level auditing in CCC which can cause some additional overhead, particularly in workloads that do heavy inserts and updates in temp tables. Unfortunately, this overhead is incurred whether you have CCC enabled or not. In SQL Server 2016 you can enable trace flag 3427 to bypass this overhead starting with SP1 CU2. Starting in SQL Server 2017 CU4, we automatically bypass this code if CCC is disabled.<br />

#### Trace Flag: 3448
Function: Introduced in the KB to fix a race condition leading to a hung database in mirroring failover situations. “ This trace flag forces new connections to keep checking for 
database state every two seconds instead of waiting for a lock for infinite time. It helps ending the connection tasks faster as the mirroring reac
hes the start of the recovery phase and releasing more worker threads to be used by database mirroring.”<br />

#### Trace Flag: 3449
Function: If you enable global TF 3449 (and you are on SQL Server 2012 SP3 CU3 or later or SQL Server 2014 SP1 CU7 or later),
you will get much better performance by avoiding a FlushCache call in a number of different common scenarios, such as backup database,
backup transaction log, create database, add a file to a database, restore a transaction log, recover a database, shrink a database file, and a SQL Server “graceful” shutdown.

<a id="6527"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 6527
Function: Disables generation of a memory dump on the first occurrence of an out-of-memory exception in CLR integration.
By default, SQL Server generates a small memory dump on the first occurrence of an out-of-memory exception in the CLR.
The behaviour of the trace flag is as follows: If this is used as a startup trace flag, a memory dump is never generated.
However, a memory dump may be generated if other trace flags are used.
If this trace flag is enabled on a running server, a memory dump will not be automatically generated from that point on.
However, if a memory dump has already been generated due to an out-of-memory exception in the CLR, this trace flag will have no effect.<br />

Function: Enables the lightweight query execution statistics profiling infrastructure.
unless your server is already CPU bound, like you’re running all the time with 95% CPU, unless you are at that point, turn on this trace flag at any server you have.
This would be my advice here because this enables that lightweight profiling infrastructure there and then you’ll see in a few minutes what it unleashes here.
So one thing that happens when I enable the lightweight profiling is that the sys.dm_exec_query_profiles DMV, which is something that actually populates the live query stats ability or feature of SSMS, now also is also populated with this lightweight profiling, which means that for all essence, we are now able to run a live query stats on all fashions at any given point in time, and this is extremely useful for let’s say a production DBA that someone calls and says, “Hey, you have a problem. To tap into running system and look at what it’s doing.”<br />

SQL Server records an event in the schedule ring buffer every time that one of the following events occurs:
a scheduler switches context to another worker, a worker is suspended, a worker is resumed, a worker enters the preemptive mode or the non-preemptive mode.
You can use the diagnostic information in this ring buffer to analyze scheduling problems.
For example, you can use the information in this ring buffer to troubleshoot problems when SQL Server stops responding.
Trace flag 8012 disables recording of events for schedulers. You can turn on trace flag 8012 only at startup.
The exception ring buffer records the last 256 exceptions that are raised on a node.
Each record contains some information about the error and contains a stack trace. A record is added to the ring buffer when an exception is raised.<br />

The automatic Soft-NUMA behavior is Hyperthread (HT/logical processor) aware.
The partitioning and creation of additional nodes scales background processing by increasing the number of listeners, scaling and network and encryption capabilities.
When Trace Flag 8079 is enabled during startup, SQL Server 2012 SP4 will interrogate the hardware layout and automatically configure Soft NUMA on systems reporting 8 or more CPUs per NUMA node.
It is recommended to first test the performance of workload with Auto-Soft NUMA before it is turned ON in production.

#### Trace Flag: 9482
**Undocumented trace flag**<br />
Function: Implements a “model variation” in the SQL 2014 cardinality estimator. The flag turns off the “overpopulated primary key” adjustment that the optimizer might use when determining that a “dimension” table (the schema could be OLTP as well) has many 
more distinct values than the “fact” table. (The seminal example is where a Date dimension is populated out into the future, but the fact table only has rows up to the current date). Since join cardinality estimation occurs based on the contents of the 
histograms of the joined columns, an “overpopulated primary key” can result in higher selectivity estimates, causing rowcount estimates to be too low.<br />

<a id="9483"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 9483
**Undocumented trace flag**<br />
Function: Implements a “model variation” in the SQL 2014 cardinality estimator. The flag will force the optimizer to create (if possible) a filtered statistics object based on a predicate in 
the query. This filtered stat object is not persisted and thus would be extremely resource intensive for frequent compilations. In Dima’s example, the filtered stat object 
is actually created on the join column...i.e. “CREATE STATISTICS [filtered stat obj] ON [table] (Join column) WHERE (predicate column = ‘literal’)”<br />

Function: Enables creation of additional indexes on internal memory-optimized staging temporal table, beside the default one.
If you have specific query pattern that includes columns which are not covered by the default index you may consider adding additional ones.<br />
**Note: System-versioned temporal tables for Memory-Optimized Tables are designed to provide high transactional throughput.
Please be aware that creating additional indexes may introduce overhead for DML operations that update or delete rows in the current table.
With the additional indexes you should aim to find the right balance between performance of temporal queries and additional DML overhead.**<br />

#### Trace Flag: 11023
Function: Disables the use of the last persisted sample rate, for all subsequent statistics update where a sample rate is not specified explicitly as part of the [UPDATE STATISTICS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/update-statistics-transact-sql) statement.<br />

<a id="11024"></a>
#### Trace Flag: 11024
Function: In Microsoft SQL Server 2017, when incremental statistics are built on the top of partitioned tables, the sum of modification counts of all partitions is stored as the modification count of the root node.
When the modification count of the root node exceeds a threshold, the auto update of statistics is triggered.
However, if the modification count of any single partition does not exceed the local threshold, the statistics are not updated.
Additionally, the modification count of the root node is reset to zero. This may cause delay in the auto update of incremental statistics.
When trace flag 11024 is enabled, the modification count of the root node is kept as the sum of modification counts of all partitions.<br />
**Note: This trace flag applies to SQL Server 2017 CU3 and higher builds.**<br />
