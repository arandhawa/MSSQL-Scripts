# SQL Server Drivers
SQL Server supports a wide variety of drivers, which are used by client applications or services to connect and query for data.
Please see below for a summary of the different drivers, both current and legacy.

[SQL Server Drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/sql-server-drivers)


## Current SQL Drivers
The following SQL Drivers are actively developed. Each driver has a support statement that can be found by following the links.

### ADO.NET
ADO.NET is a library that is a standard part of the .Net framework. It is a C# implementation of the TDS protocol, which is supported by all modern versions of SQL Server.
This driver is developed, tested, and supported by Microsoft.

### JDBC
The JDBC SQL driver is a Java implementation of the TDS protocol, which is supported by all modern versions of SQL Server. This driver is developed, tested, and supported by Microsoft.

### ODBC
The ODBC SQL driver is a C++ implementation of the TDS protocol, which is supported by all modern versions of SQL Server. This driver is developed, tested, and supported by Microsoft.

### PHP
The PHP SQL driver relies on the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver to handle the low-level communication with SQL Server. This driver is developed, tested, and supported by Microsoft.

### Node.js
The tedious module is a javascript implementation of the TDS protocol, which is supported by all modern versions of SQL Server. The driver is an open source project, available on Github.

### Python
The pymssql module is a Python implementation of the TDS protocol, which is supported by all modern versions of SQL Server.

2. [Python SQL Driver - pymssql](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/pymssql/python-sql-driver-pymssql)


### Ruby
The TinyTDS gem is a Ruby implementation of the TDS protocol, which is supported by all modern versions of SQL Server.

## Legacy SQL Drivers
The following SQL Drivers were developed and tested by Microsoft, but are not recommended to be used for new development.
Each driver has a support statement that can be found by following the links.


## OLEDB
The OLE DB provider will not be included after SQL Server 2012.

[Microsoft OLE DB](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms722784.aspx)


### ADO
The ADO SQL driver has a direct dependency on the OLE DB provider. As such, it will not be supported after SQL Server 2012.
